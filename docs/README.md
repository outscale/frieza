  Cleanup your cloud ressources!
</p>

# Usecases

The main usecase is to free all resources inside a cloud account (e.g. `frieza nuke regionEu2`)

An other usecase is to use Frieza for cleaning additional resources since a known state:
1. You want to keep important resources on your account (virtual machines, volumes, etc)
2. Make a "snapshot" (e.g. `frieza snap new cleanAccountState regionEu2`
3. Run some experiment which create a number of resources
4. Once done, cleanup those additional resources with `frieza clean cleanAccountState`

## Manage Profiles

The subcommand `profile` allow you to manage all your provider configuration and test them.
Profiles are stored by default with frieza configuration in `~/.frieza/config.json`.

```
frieza profile new outscale_oapi --help
frieza profile new outscale_oapi myDevAccount --region=eu-west-2 --ak=XXX --sk=YYY
frieza profile test myDevAccount
frieza profile list
frieza profile describe myDevAccount
frieza profile rm myDevAccount
```

## Manage Snapshots

Frieza snapshots are only a listing of resources from one or more profiles at a specific time.
Snapshots are stored by default in `~/.frieza/snapshots/`.

```
frieza snapshot new myFristSnap myDevAccount myOtherAccount
frieza snapshot list
frieza snapshot describe myFristSnap
frieza snapshot rm myFristSnap
```

## Delete resources

To delete all newly created resources since myFristSnap:
```
frieza clean myFristSnap
```

To delete ALL resources of a profile:
```
frieza nuke myDevAccount
```

Note that a listing of deleted resources is show before any action.

Confirmation is asked by default but you can overide this behavior with `--auto-approve` option.

## Set configuration

Frieza has a number of options which can set or unset.
Feel free to explore `frieza config` sub-commands.
